# Space Invaders 👾 - Python Edition

The classic Space Invaders arcade game rebuilt entirely in Python. 

## Description

This project recreates the retro arcade game where the player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, shooting a descending army of alien invaders. The game features collision detection, animated sprites, score tracking, and win/loss conditions.

## Features

* **Player Control:** Left to right movement and shooting mechanics.
* **Enemy AI:** Enemies move in a grid pattern, shifting down little by little.
* **Animation:** Displays a frame every second for enemy movement and explosion effects.
* **Game Over Conditions:**
    * **Victory:** Destroy all enemies.
    * **Defeat:** An enemy reaches the player's defense line.

## Prerequisites

To run this game, you need to have **Python 3.x** installed. 

No external libraries are required, as this only uses the standard `turtle` and `time` modules.
